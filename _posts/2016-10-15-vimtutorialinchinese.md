之前在学Vim用法的时候，苦于没有很好的方法记住Vim众多的命令快捷键用法，我一直认为Vim应该有更能让人理解的方法记住快捷键命令。直到我发现了一篇博文，通过把Vim命令当然一组语言来学习和记忆命令，让我豁然开朗，于是便有了把此博文翻译的想法。
以下是我的译文地址，在文章头上特别附上另一篇很有用的配置Vim的文章，供诸君参考。

At the time when I was learning Vim, I was annoyed by all those command shortcuts that need to be memoried. I was certain that there is a more intuitive way to remember all those commands. And I found it after came across a blog article tutorial which use vim command as a language. That was when I wanted to translate that article into Chinese. See link to my translation above.
