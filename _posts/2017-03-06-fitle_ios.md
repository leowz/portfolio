Fitle is an online shopping sizing solution provider located in Paris France. It provides a comprehensive sizing solution to its clients which include many influential French online shopping sites. 
I integreted into Fitle mobile developping team. My job is to develop new features for the Fitle iOS App as well as maintain the code and debug.
The main feature of the app is that it displays a 3D model created according to the user`s measurements data, and shows how it looks with different clothes of which the use chose. 
OpenGL ES,Swift3/OC,3rd party frameworks are involved in the development.

我的工作主要是在移动开发团队里负责开发和运营其iOS应用。其应用的最主要卖点就是，根据用户个人身材数据，生成个人化的3D模型，并且可以在模型上展示穿上各种衣服之后的效果和和身情况。
其设计的主要技术包括OpenGL ES，Swift3/OC，以及其他第三方库等。
